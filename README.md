# IDEA: (OPTIMISED IDEA - IN (N*LOGN))

- IDEA: sort the lists by id
- IDEA: use a while loop to iterate through both lists
- IDEA: if the id's match, merge the dicts
- IDEA: if the id's don't match, add the smaller id to the list
- IDEA: if one list is empty, add the other list to the end of the new list
- IDEA: return the new list

## I have 

# Python Task 1

Complete the function in `main.py`, by merging the information from list_1 and list_2
to create a new list, which has all the information about each student from
both lists in one single dict.

- Both lists are unsorted
- Both lists can have missing values (for ex list_2 has missing id=2)
